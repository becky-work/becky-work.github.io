I deal with a lot of wide data sets. The -omics field is full of them. I've been working mostly with metabolomic and microbiome data in a clinical setting. This means...

<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Hello small sample sizes with hundreds of variables to test!</h2>

It's definitely been an interesting switch from working with retail and advertising data where you can have tons of variables but there's a huge sample size of ad clicks to work with. Not to mention study designs that aren't fully clear.

I mostly work in R. I occasionally code in Python, but I always felt that the R community was more welcoming and kind. I have mixed feelings on Tableau. You can make some gorgeous user friendly dashboards using it but the moment you want to do something a bit weird it becomes a huge pain to make it work. The list continues to grow on languages and software that I've used. It's hard to beat something that is free and easy to control every aspect.

This is mostly for myself. Instead of opening random R files to remember how to do something I think this might be a better organization method. Plus! I don't want to look bad so things should stay clean and *gasp* have comments.
