title: "how_to"

Going to be a mess but general idea of how I started. [Followed this guy's demo](https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/08/08/how-to-make-an-rmarkdown-website/) and bought a [Google domain name](https://domains.google).

Needed

- github account
- netlify sign in with github
- google domain
- Rstudio (duh)

After every time you want to update the site do 
````rmarkdown::render_site()````

and commit to git
